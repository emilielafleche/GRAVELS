# GRAVELS
Hello, and thanks for checking out GRAVELS! Our mission is to design, test, and 3D print tools for geological research and sample collection at space analog sites across the world. We have decided to make these tools open-access and free for everyone!

These tools were custom-designed by crews at LunAres Research Station, an analog site in Poland, for Project GRAVELS (Geological Research and Analyses Via EVA Lunar Sample collection). The RoxBox 1.0 design was created to fit onto the LEO rover (https://www.leorover.tech/) and uses the ISS Sample Containers (scaled up or down depending on box dimensions) accessible at the NASA 3D print resources page (https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/iss-tools). RoxBox 2.0 is a sample collection box that also fits onto LEO, but uses a Raspberry Pi setup to automatically rotate during EVA sample collection. 

As GRAVELS continues to be worked on by future crews, more tools will be added to this directory. Stay tuned!
